# simulated_scripted_exposure_study
This repository is used for a simulated scripted exposure study in Potsdam. The aim of the study is to assess air quality using sonification. The study design should ensure robust air quality values and good comparability during the study.

Results of our study in Potsdam were presented at ICAD2023 in Sweden. The related paper can be found [here](https://www13.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/arnrich/publications/ICAD2023_Terboven_Steckhan.pdf).
